Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development technique that encourages collaboration among developers, testers and business stakeholders.

Gherkin Language?
-----------------
Gherkin is a structured language that is used to write BDD tests.
It uses a specific syntax that is easy to read and understand for both technical and non-technical team members.

Gherkin scenarios are written in a Given-When-Then format to describe the expected behavior of the system in a clear and concise manner.

in BDD, "Given-When-And-Then-But" is the proposed approach for writing test cases.
